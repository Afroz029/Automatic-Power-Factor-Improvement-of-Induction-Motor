Induction motors are widely used in industries and households because of their simple design, durability, and low cost. However, they usually operate at a low power factor, particularly under light load conditions. A low power factor leads to excessive reactive power consumption, higher transmission losses, and poor voltage regulation. In many cases, power utilities also impose penalty charges when the power factor falls below the specified value. To address this, automatic power factor improvement (APFI) systems are used.
The APFI model continuously monitors the motorâ€™s power factor by measuring voltage and current and calculating real power (P) and reactive power (Q). The power factor is obtained from the ratio of real power to apparent power. When the value drops below a preset limit, a control unit (Arduino UNO in this model) activates capacitor banks through circuit breakers. These capacitors provide the required reactive power to the motor locally, thereby reducing the demand on the supply and improving the power factor.
This system also tracks important parameters such as rotor speed and electromagnetic torque. The automatic adjustment of capacitors ensures efficient motor operation, reduction of line losses, and avoidance of power factor penalties, making the system reliable and cost-effective.
